- a functional application that takes data from ferries and land transportation  to amke a complete travel planner and to understand how to work in teams as an insight to future professional work situations with the use of Scrum

What do we need to know? 
- We need to know that required aspects are needed for the project and more information on what needs to be done to create a plan on how to take user stories and divide to task that we will be doin

FEEDBACK

Were the assumptions correct?
- we are currently in the first week and detailed information regarding the project will be given the next week

What did we learn? 
- This week we learned information about the project RTF and their plan to make travelling much better but centralizing data from ferries. We also learned about visons, scope and breaking down these to user stories and task.

Can we show improvement?
- We can definitely show improvement throughout the project which will be seen in the process of making the application we want
