agile project

WHAT IS

What are we assuming?

current assumption on the project is that we will be using the data from the norwegian implementation of SIRI and NeteX data in order to simulate how the app would take in
data from a ferry and use that on the application we are making. We will the create our own version of the SIRI and NeteX Data of what we think it might look like coming from a ferry company like Stena Line

WHAT MIGHT OR SHOULD BE

What do we want to achieve?

We want to learn the specifics of SIRI and NeTex implementation in order to make a data we can use for our application


FEEDBACK

Were the assumptions correct?

WE had an issue about the data as we thought that we are receiving SIRI and  NeTex data from stena line but we found out that these data do not
exist therefore we will have to create these mock datas to test out application

What did we learn?

This week we learned a lot about the implementation of SIRI and Netex in the norwegian transportation and we learned how to use android studio. we also had some insight on 
how to work in an agile way and are learning more in way to make our meeting more efficient

Can we show improvement?

Next week we can possible show what we learned about SIRI and NeTex in our application and our usage of Android Studio as a develepment environment
